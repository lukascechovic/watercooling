**Note:** Question about if EKWB D5/DDC pump can be used in aluminium loop, answer is **NO**

***Question 1:*** Hello, I would like to buy pupm from you into custom aluminium loop (alu blocks and radiators). I got confused with note in your products "This product should NOT be installed with any aluminum Fluid Gaming parts!" . Does it means I cannot use it in Aluminium containing loop? Could you please explaint to me that note and are your pumps suitable to work in custom all aluminium loop? Thanks. Have a nice day.

***Answer 1:*** Hello, thank you for contacting us. The mentioned product is not compatible with ALU parts. We used to sell products that were compatible with ALU products. Unfortunately, we no longer sell ALU products. We still have some ALU water blocks or fittings available. Unfortunately, radiators and water pumps are no longer available.

***Question 2:*** Can the 'EK-Classic Pump Reservoir 160 SPC PWM' be used in an aluminum loop?

***Answer 2:*** The EK-Classic Pump Reservoir 160 SPC PWM can be used in an aluminum loop but you will have to replace the nickel-plated brass plug with a plastic one.

***Question 1:*** Hello, I'm looking for pump into full alluminium loop. Its for custom machine with low diametter tubing (4 or 6 mm) in total length up to 10m, with 7 small aluminium blocks. If I'm not wrong I should look for higher head meters value pump. I'm searching for answers for several days but no luck for now. Last info I got is that I cannot use even stainless steel parts pump with aluminium. VPP655 pumps are marked as ceramic and plastic (Kunststoff;Keramik;) but on video they've definitely got some other metal inside. What pumps I can use in aluminium containing loop? Thanks for answer. Have a nice day.

***Answer 1:*** Hi Lukas​, you can use all pump sin our assortment for full copper or aluminium loops. https://shop.alphacool.com/shop/pumpen/

***Question 2:*** "What type of metal fittings other than aluminium  can be used in full aluminium loops?  Stainless steel, brass, other?"

***Answer 2:*** Hi Lukas, thank you for getting back. Our fittings are all anodized, painted or nickel-plated and they have no contact with the liquid, so you can use any of our fittings in your loop.

***Question 3:*** "It is possible to use multiple outputs/inputs same time on the Alphacool Eisdecke Laing DDC Acryl top V.2 or Alphacool Eisdecke DDC Acryl top V.4? For example if I need to have/create two loops?"

***Answer 3:*** Hi Lukas​, I am sorry but it isn´t possible to use multiple Outs on the products. **It isn´t also recommended to make a parallel loop. If you want two different loops, you will need two pumps and reservoirs.

***Question 1:*** Hello guys,

looking for advices to optimize watercooling build for 3d printer and choose rigth components.

Setting:
-> 500wats TDP max
-> Aluminium cooling blocks on components
-> M5 and M6 threads on aluminium blocks = fittings only for 4/2.5 and 6/4 mm tubing (OD/ID) (one moving component (printihead) needs to stay on 4/2.5 tubing due to moving restrictions and weigth)
-> length of tubing max 10meters (7 components around the machine)
-> difference between highest and lowest point on machine is 0.5m
-> No hard space restrictions for radiator and pump (but more compact and visually pleasing solution is preffered)
-> prefered silent (low/no vibration operation)

Concerns:
-> choosing rigth pump for length of the loop and tubing diametters
-> choosing big enough radiator for the TDP (aluminium one due to alu blocks on components)
-> topogy of the cooling (atleast two loops ? - one for 4/2.5 tubing and one for 6/4 tubing)

So far I was thinking about:
Radiator: Alphacool ES Aluminium 360 mm T27
Fans: Yate Loon D12SH-12 with plug (2200rpm) ( 120x120x25mm )
Pump: ??
Topology: two loops

Thanks for ideas!!

PS: Some alphacool water pumps have this statement in description "Please use only in conjunction with clear transparent water cooling fluids. The particles and additives in Pastel liquids can clog and permanently damage water cooling products such as radiators, pumps, coolers and hoses.". I cant use any color premixed collants with this items or it is some special kind of colored coolants liquids and apply only for "pastels ones"?

***Answer 1:*** 1 D5 pump should be all you need unless you are doing discrete loops. If you are cooling multiple components you don't need multiple loops. Just run it in series and you'll be fine and save some money and headaches. I'd recommend staying away from dyes just to be safe. I use Mystic Fog in my rig for the RGB effect but I accept the risk of clogs and higher maintenance involved. That rad should work fine for 500 watts. Those fans should be fine also.
Edit: Just use this coolant for the best performance and longevity of the loop.
